SYNOPSIS
sc_stats \*LOPTIONS\*O
.PP
 
DESCRIPTION .PP

sc_stats is a program which statistically compares the performance of
two or more Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems which have been
run on identical test data.  Sc_stats is part of the \*LNIST SCTK\*O Scoring Tookit. The program reads alignments generated by
sclite, and produces \*L summary reports
\*O, \*Lgraphs and/or compares the
systems using any number tests of significant differences.

Input File Options: 
.RS
These options control/define the input to sc_stats.  Input must
come from stdin and the -p option must be used.  (Forcing the user to
use the -p option enables future expandability while maintaining backward
compatability.)
.br
.br
-p	
.RS
Alignments are read from 'stdin' as  input  to  sc_stats.
The  format  of  the input must be in the "sgml" output
format, created either by '-o sgml' or by  piped  input
from another sctk utility.

Output Options:

-e desc

Description of the ensemble of hyp files.
.RE
-O output_dir 
.RS
Writes all output files into output_dir.  Defaults to the
hypfile's directory
.RE
-n name 
.RS
Writes all multiple hypothesis file reports to files beginning
with 'name'.  Using '-' writes to stdout. Default: 'Ensemble'
.RE
.RE
Report Generation Options: 
.RS
-g
.RS
Generate per speaker range graphs, based on the formula defined
by '-f'.  The reports are written to files whose root name
begins with the values defined by '-n'.  There are two graphs
produced, one showing speaker performance variability across
systems and the
second showing system performance variablity for across speakers.
.PP
- The 'range' graphs are an ASCII
representation of the
of the variablity in error rates for a given speaker.  The
graph is sorted be the mean of statistic computed for each speaker.
\*LEXAMPLE\*O
.PP
 - The 'grange' graph is a gnuplot version of the same data
ploted in 'range.  There are two sets of files created. 
The first set, which is called '*.grange.spk.plt' and
'*.grange.spk.dat', contains the gnuplot command files and
data files respectively for the speaker performance variability 
across systems graph.
The second set, which is called '*.grange.sys.plt' and
'*.grange.sys.dat', contains the gnuplot command files and
data files respectively for the system
performance variability across speakers graph.
\*LEXAMPLE\*O
.PP
 - The 'grange2' graph is similar to the 'grange'
graph except that each systems speaker word error scores are 
identified by a unique symbol.
