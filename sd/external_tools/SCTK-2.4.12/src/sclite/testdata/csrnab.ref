AS COMPETITION IN THE MUTUAL FUND BUSINESS GROWS INCREASINGLY INTENSE MORE PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY APPEAR WILLING TO SACRIFICE INTEGRITY IN THE NAME OF PERFORMANCE (4T0C0201)
FOR A TWO TRILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS BUILT ON PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THIS TREND IS DISHEARTENING AT BEST AND DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS AT WORST (4T0C0202)
SO FAR THIS YEAR THE { INDUSTRY'S / INDUSTRY } SLIDE HAS BEEN APPARENT IN ALLEGATIONS OF INSIDER TRADING BY FUND MANAGERS UNSAVORY FUND SALES PRACTICES AT BANKS AND THE USE OF HIGH RISK DERIVATIVE SECURITIES IN NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE MONEY MARKET FUNDS (4T0C0203)
and in the latest blow to public confidence in the funds someone at industry titan fidelity investments decided last friday to send newspapers thursday's prices for most fidelity funds because the friday data wasn't ready (4t0c0204)
in the ensuing public humiliation suffered by fidelity this week as it was forced to fess up to its intentional mistake the company has sought to make clear that nobody bought or sold a fund direct from fidelity at the wrong price (4t0c0205)
THOUGH NEWSPAPERS LAST SATURDAY UNKNOWINGLY LISTED THURSDAY PRICES FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF FIDELITY'S TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT FUNDS THE COMPANY SAYS TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED FRIDAY WERE MADE AT THE CORRECT PRICES WHICH FIDELITY RECEIVED AFTER IT MET NEWSPAPER DEADLINES WITH THE WRONG DATA EARLY FRIDAY EVENING (4T0C0206)
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT MOST { FIDELITY'S / FIDELITY } SHAREHOLDERS WERE LIED TO IN VARYING DEGREES IF THEY LOOKED AT THEIR FUND PRICES IN NEWSPAPERS LAST WEEKEND (4T0C0207)
THE UNIDENTIFIED FIDELITY EMPLOYEE WHO MADE THE DECISION TO GO WITH INCORRECT PRICES SHOULD SIMPLY HAVE LISTED THEM AS NOT AVAILABLE (4T0C0208)
THAT WOULD BE STANDARD FIDELITY PROCEDURE SAID JANE JAMIESON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT THE BOSTON BASED COMPANY (4T0C0209)
FIDELITY'S MISTAKE AND MOST OF THE SELF ADMINISTERED BLACK EYES SUFFERED BY THE FUND INDUSTRY THIS YEAR HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED WERE PLAYING BY THE RULES EITHER THE FUND { COMPANIES' / COMPANY'S } INTERNAL RULES OR THE PRUDENT MAN RULE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO GOVERN THE INVESTMENT OF MONEY ENTRUSTED BY THE PUBLIC TO ALLEGEDLY PROFESSIONAL MONEY MANAGERS (4T0C020A)
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT CAN BECOME VERY TEMPTING TO BEND OR BREAK THE RULES IN THE NAME OF STAYING COMPETITIVE (4T0C020B)
TAKE FIDELITY'S CASE AS AN EXAMPLE (4T0C020C)
SOMEONE THERE HAD TO MAKE A FAST DECISION WHEN A SOFTWARE PROBLEM RESULTED IN BOTCHED FUND PRICES LAST FRIDAY SHORTLY BEFORE THE COMPANY WAS DUE TO REPORT THE DAY'S DATA TO THE NEWSPAPERS (4T0C020D)
IF FIDELITY HAD PROVIDED NO PRICES FOR MOST OF ITS FUNDS THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO BE HAVING A PROBLEM THAT WASN'T SHARED BY OTHER FUND COMPANIES WHICH OF COURSE WAS TRUE (4T0C020E)
MOREOVER INVESTORS WHO COMPARE FUND PRICES AND PERFORMANCE BY USING WEEKEND NEWSPAPERS WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE DATA ON FIDELITY FUNDS PERHAPS COSTING FIDELITY SOME NEW INVESTMENT (4T0C020F)
