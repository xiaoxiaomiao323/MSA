2347 a 2347-a 103.55 109.17 <O,NA> i have worked outside of the home and i was in one of those safe occupations i was a school teacher
2347 a 2347-a 109.90 115.43 <O,WA> and we had one child when i taught for my two year career { um / uh } we { um / uh } then
2347 a 2347-a 115.43 121.12
2347 a 2347-a 121.14 130.1 <O,NA> home with those children and raised those children and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching which
2347 a 2347-a 130.53 137.01 <O,NA> if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering
2347 a 2347-a 137.10 144.48 <O,WA> because your fighting for your life but i am a fighter and i've always been a disciplinarian { um / uh } i'm
2347 a 2347-a 144.58 150.46 <O,NA> i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them
2347 a 2347-a 150.48 159.5 <O,NA> imply i think they're going in by choice yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the
2347 a 2347-a 159.50 167.03 <O,NA> male needs to be the dominant person and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town
2347 a 2347-a 167.04 176.37 <O,WA> of five thousand { um / uh } are not letting that happen they are very aggressive they're { um / uh } they almost
2347 a 2347-a 176.39 182.98 <O,WA> have what i would call a killer { e- / @ } killer bee instinct and they have to be in charge
2347 a 2347-a 183.11 299.63 <O,WA> and and i { th- / @ } i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands uhhuh oh sure uhhuh huh uhhuh
2347 b 2347-b 0.00 20.51 <O,WA> { um / uh } all right uhhuh oh well i tend i tend to agree { um / uh } in
2347 b 2347-b 20.51 25.06 <O,WA> some ways i think it's { um / uh } i think if anything a lot of { um / uh } the
2347 b 2347-b 25.07 31.12 <O,WA> changes that have occurred { um / uh } in some ways they're for the better because i think women should
2347 b 2347-b 31.12 35.86 <O,NA> have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what
2347 b 2347-b 35.89 43.64 <O,WA> you would like to do with your life but by the same token and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not worked { um / uh } { um / uh }
2347 b 2347-b 43.64 54.81 <O,WA> that it makes it { um / uh } sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what { um / uh } women should or should not be
2347 b 2347-b 54.82 66.66 <O,WA> doing that it it { um / uh } it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with with the child care and
2347 b 2347-b 66.71 76.33 <O,WA> and with { um / uh } pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that { um / uh } that you need to do at
3129 a 3129-a 17.31 106.23 <O,WA> we exactly oh did you do the diagnosis or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed uhhuh uhhuh yeah i know { um / uh } when working with the { um / uh } flashers there is
3129 a 3129-a 106.23 127.18 <O,WA> { um / uh } usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam diagram yeah i don't even know if my current cars have
3129 a 3129-a 127.21 142.44 <O,NA> a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit like the the headlamp you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that
3129 a 3129-a 142.46 170.18 <O,NA> a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse so that's a possibility is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for 
3129 a 3129-a 170.19 272.8 <O,WA> { um / uh } old imports who { um / uh } so it's not j c whitney or somebody like that yeah have you found any { um / uh } { um / uh } reliable import service people in the metroplex oh yeah uhhuh i'll be darned uhhuh
3129 b 3129-b 185.79 205.65 <O,NA> is not either it's obviously doesn't quite fit so it must be for a different year so i'll have to try to return that as well well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car
3129 b 3129-b 205.66 217.79 <O,WA> because i've owned this car since it was new and { um / uh } but it's over like in the brook hollow industrial district down on stemmons and inwood area and i hadn't used him for some years and the
3129 b 3129-b 217.80 228.34 <O,WA> last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of { um / uh } all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on { um / uh } german
3129 b 3129-b 228.39 243.05 <O,WA> cars and german cars i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on british cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it so { um / uh } { um / uh } i
3129 b 3129-b 243.05 252.17 <O,WA> may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll { um / uh } i should be able to take it in and check that part out
