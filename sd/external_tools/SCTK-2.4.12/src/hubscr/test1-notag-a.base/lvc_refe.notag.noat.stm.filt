2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 103.53 103.55

2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 130.1 130.53
2347 A 2347-A 130.53 137.01 IF ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT SOME DAYS IT'S FUN AND SOME DAYS YOU WONDER WHY YOU'RE EVEN BOTHERING

2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 144.48 144.58
2347 A 2347-A 144.58 150.46 I'M NOT REAL SURE THAT THE YOUNG GIRLS OF TODAY ARE BEING FORCED INTO THE JOB MARKET AS MANY OF THEM
2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 150.46 150.48
2347 A 2347-A 150.48 159.5 IMPLY I THINK THEY'RE GOING IN BY CHOICE YES AND AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I THINK THE
2347 A 2347-A 159.50 167.03 MALE NEEDS TO BE THE DOMINANT PERSON AND I THINK TOO MANY OF THE YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WIVES IN OUR SMALL TOWN
2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 167.03 167.04
2347 A 2347-A 167.04 176.37 OF FIVE THOUSAND { UM / UH } ARE NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN THEY ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE THEY'RE { UM / UH } THEY ALMOST
2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 176.37 176.39
2347 A 2347-A 176.39 182.98 HAVE WHAT I WOULD CALL A KILLER E- KILLER BEE INSTINCT AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN CHARGE
2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 182.98 183.11
2347 A 2347-A 183.11 299.63 AND AND I TH- I THINK THEY LOSE A LOT BY WHAT I CALL NEUTERING THEIR HUSBANDS UHHUH OH SURE UHHUH HUH UHHUH
2347 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 299.63 9999
2347 B 2347-B 0.00 20.51 { UM / UH } ALL RIGHT UHHUH OH WELL I TEND I TEND TO AGREE { UM / UH } IN
2347 B 2347-B 20.51 25.06 SOME WAYS I THINK IT'S { UM / UH } I THINK IF ANYTHING A LOT OF { UM / UH } THE
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 25.06 25.07
2347 B 2347-B 25.07 31.12 CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED { UM / UH } IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE FOR THE BETTER BECAUSE I THINK WOMEN SHOULD
2347 B 2347-B 31.12 35.86 HAVE A CHOICE AND I DO BELIEVE IN THE BEING ABLE TO HAVE A CHOICE AS TO AS FAR AS WHAT
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 35.86 35.89
2347 B 2347-B 35.89 43.64 YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN AND I KNOW THIS FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I'VE WORKED AND I'VE NOT WORKED { UM / UH } { UM / UH }
2347 B 2347-B 43.64 54.81 THAT IT MAKES IT { UM / UH } SOMETIMES IT MAKES LIFE MORE DIFFICULT I THINK WHEN THE ROLES NOW ARE LESS DEFINED AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT { UM / UH } WOMEN SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 54.81 54.82
2347 B 2347-B 54.82 66.66 DOING THAT IT IT { UM / UH } IT CAN MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT THERE ARE MORE THINGS TO WORK OUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS WITH WITH THE CHILD CARE AND
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 66.66 66.71
2347 B 2347-B 66.71 76.33 AND WITH { UM / UH } PLEASING YOU KNOW YOUR BOSS ON THE JOB SO YOU HAVE ADDED STRESSES FROM THERE AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT { UM / UH } THAT YOU NEED TO DO
2347 B 2347-B 76.33 85.71 AT HOME A- AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOUR YOUR GOING OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR SO MANY HOURS A DAY DOESN'T { UM / UH } MAKE THOSE OTHER THINGS GO AWAY AND THE
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 85.71 85.76
2347 B 2347-B 85.76 98.9 OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES ARE STILL IMPORTANT { UM / UH } SO { UM / UH } HAVE YOU HAVE YOU WORKED OUTSIDE ALSO AND { UM / UH } FEEL THAT IT THAT WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL AS FAR AS { UM / UH } WHAT
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 98.9 98.91
2347 B 2347-B 98.91 192.7 WOULD BE A HAPPY MEDIUM OR OR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YES UHHUH UHHUH YES YES RIGHT BUT YEAH OH I B- I THINK SO YES UHHUH UHHUH YEAH UHHUH WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK THOUGH { UM / UH } { UM / UH } I
2347 B 2347-B 192.70 208.68 DON'T KNOW I THE THE ONE PROBLEM I GUESS I HAVE AND MAYBE WHAT SO MANY WOMEN YOUNGER WOMEN NOW ARE CHOOSING TO GO OUTSIDE IS I FEEL THAT IN GENERAL IN THIS SOCIETY THAT BEING AT HOME IS NOT LOOKED
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 208.68 208.69
2347 B 2347-B 208.69 219.09 UPON AS { UM / UH } A JOB IN ITSELF WHEREAS YOU KNOW YOU HEAR A LOT OF WOMEN THAT ARE HOME SAYING THAT IT IS A JOB IN ITSELF BUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING AND I I
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 219.09 219.10
2347 B 2347-B 219.10 223.67 WAS A- AN ENGINEER SO I I WAS ALWAYS WITH MEN { UM / UH } AND THEY
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 223.67 223.68
2347 B 2347-B 223.68 235.33 WERE SINGLE MANY OF THEM AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WELL MY DAY DOESN'T END WHEN I LEAVE AT I USED TO LEAVE AT THREE KEEP GOING TO ELEVEN AT NIGHT AND THEY HAD THEY USED TO LOOK DOWN
2347 B 2347-B 235.33 243.21 ON WOMEN THAT WERE HOME THEY'D SAY OH I BET YOU GO HOME AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST YOU GET OUT OF HERE AT THREE AND YOU CAN GO HOME AND PUT YOUR FEET UP AND WATCH SOAP OPERAS AND I

2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 256.71 256.80
2347 B 2347-B 256.80 271.58 I THINK THAT ONE REASON THAT SO MANY YOUNGER WOMEN FEEL IM- COMPELLED TO GO INTO A PROFESSION IS THAT THEY FEEL THAT IF THEY STAY HOME THEY ARE NOT RESPECTED AND THAT BEING HOME IS NOT A
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 271.58 271.59
2347 B 2347-B 271.59 281.87 RESPECTABLE { UM / UH } POSITION IN SOCIETY AND THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH TO THAT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU WERE HOME AND WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK YOU GOT
2347 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 281.87 281.91
2347 B 2347-B 281.91 299.79 BUT I CAN SEE WITH THE YOUNGER MEN THAT THEY DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING DOWN UPON WOMEN THAT ARE HOME AND YET BY THE SAME TOKEN I THINK SOME OF IT IS JEALOUSY YOU YOU ONCE IN A WHILE YOU HEAR THEM SAY THINGS LIKE I WISH I HAD THE CHOICE YOU

3129 A 3129-A 106.23 127.18 { UM / UH } USUALLY A A SPECIAL FUSE THAT OPERATES THE FLASHERS DO YOU HAVE A SEPARATE FUSE FOR YOUR HIGH BEAM AS OPPOSED TO YOUR LOW BEAM DIAGRAM YEAH I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MY CURRENT CARS HAVE
3129 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 127.18 127.21
3129 A 3129-A 127.21 142.44 A SEPARATE FUSE I KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK THERE ARE THINGS RUNNING WHILE THEY'RE AT THE SAME UNIT LIKE THE THE HEADLAMP YOU TEND TO THINK WELL THERE'S ONE FUSE OPERATING THE WHOLE THING BUT SOMETIMES THE EXTRA AMPERAGE THAT
3129 A INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 142.44 142.46
3129 A 3129-A 142.46 170.18 A HIGH BEAM DRIVES AS OPPOSED TO A LOW BEAM REQUIRES THE USE OF A OF A MAYBE A HIGHER FUSE SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY IS THIS A A MAIL ORDER PARTS HOUSE THAT SPECIALIZES IN IN PARTS FOR

3129 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 10.17 10.22
3129 B 3129-B 10.22 19.43 WORKING { UM / UH } THIS IS THE TYPE OF { UM / UH } SWITCH WHERE YOU FLIP THE THE LEVER THE TURN SIGNAL ON THE COLUMN AND WHEN I WOULD { UM / UH } PUT IT IN
3129 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 19.43 19.45
3129 B 3129-B 19.45 31.62 THE BRIGHT LIGHT POSITION THE LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT COMPLETELY WHICH IS EVEN WORSE THAN THEM JUST NOT GETTING BRIGHT AND I HAD PRESUMED THAT IT WAS THE SWITCH AND { UM / UH } THIS IS { UM / UH } AN

3129 B 3129-B 31.74 40.49 OLDER CAR IT'S { A SEVENTY TWO / SEVENTY TWO } { M G / MG } SO I HAD TO MAIL ORDER THE PART { UM / UH } WHICH I HAD DONE AND TONIGHT I WENT OUT AND { UM / UH } AT
3129 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 40.49 40.50
3129 B 3129-B 40.50 52.28 LEAST HOOKED IN THE NEW PART ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THAT APPARENTLY IS NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S NOT IN THE SWITCH BECAUSE IT DOES THE SAME THING WITH THE NEW SWITCH SO I'LL BE FACED WITH HAVING TO RETURN THAT PRODUCT { UM / UH } AND
3129 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 52.28 52.32
3129 B 3129-B 52.32 70.35 HOPING THAT { UM / UH } YOU KNOW THAT THEY WILL ACCEPT IT ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BOX IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT BEEN REALLY USED { UM / UH } I HAD DONE WHAT DIAGNOSIS I COULD PRIMARILY BY
3129 B 3129-B 70.35 84.03 LOOKING AT A WIRING DIAGRAM THAT I DID HAVE OF THE CAR AND { UM / UH } PRETTY MUCH DECIDED HAD TO BE THE PROBLEM I TALKED TO ONE MECHANIC ABOUT IT AND HE SUSPECTED THE SWITCH ALSO { UM / UH } BUT

3129 B 3129-B 123.65 164.18 THAT UHHUH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WHAT I'VE TYPICALLY FOUND WHEN THAT { UM / UH } COMPANIES ARE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT ACCEPTING RETURNS ON PRODUCTS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEEDED AFTER ALL AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE
3129 B INTER_SEGMENT_GAP 164.18 164.22
3129 B 3129-B 164.22 185.76 CASE THIS TIME RIGHT EXACTLY IT'S OUT OF { UM / UH } KANSAS SOMEWHERE NO IT'S NOT I ALSO GOT A PIECE OF CHROME FOR THE THE HOOD THAT THEY HAD INDICATED WAS THE RIGHT PART FOR THIS CAR BUT { UM / UH } IT
