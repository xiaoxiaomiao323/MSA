2347 a 2347-a 1.06 3.47 <O,WA> I'VE { UM / UH } A\;S FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
2347 a 2347-a 3.47 11.04 <O,WA> I FIND THAT THE YOUNG WOMEN HAVE LOST SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE { -A / @ } AND MORE DOMINATING
2347 a 2347-a 11.06 15.84 <O,NA>
2347 a 2347-a 15.94 103.53 <O,WA> NOW I WOULD LIKE { UM / UH / I } YES
2347 a 2347-a 103.55 109.17 <O,NA> I HAVE WORKED OUTSIDE OF THE HOME AND I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE SAFE OCCUPATIONS I WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER
2347 a 2347-a 109.90 115.43 <O,WA> AND WE HAD ONE CHILD WHEN I TAUGHT FOR MY TWO YEAR CAREER { UM / UH } WE { UM / UH } THEN
2347 a 2347-a 115.43 121.12
2347 a 2347-a 121.14 130.1 <O,NA> HOME WITH THOSE CHILDREN AND RAISED THOSE CHILDREN AND NOW THAT MY HUSBAND HAS RETIRED I AM BACK SUBSTITUTE TEACHING WHICH
2347 a 2347-a 130.53 137.01 <O,NA> IF ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT SOME DAYS IT'S FUN AND SOME DAYS YOU WONDER WHY YOU'RE EVEN BOTHERING
2347 a 2347-a 137.10 144.48 <O,WA> BECAUSE YOUR FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE BUT I AM A FIGHTER AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A DISCIPLINARIAN { UM / UH } I'M
2347 a 2347-a 144.58 150.46 <O,NA> I'M NOT REAL SURE THAT THE YOUNG GIRLS OF TODAY ARE BEING FORCED INTO THE JOB MARKET AS MANY OF THEM
2347 a 2347-a 150.48 159.5 <O,NA> IMPLY I THINK THEY'RE GOING IN BY CHOICE YES AND AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I THINK THE
2347 a 2347-a 159.50 167.03 <O,NA> MALE NEEDS TO BE THE DOMINANT PERSON AND I THINK TOO MANY OF THE YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WIVES IN OUR SMALL TOWN
2347 a 2347-a 167.04 176.37 <O,WA> OF FIVE THOUSAND { UM / UH } ARE NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN THEY ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE THEY'RE { UM / UH } THEY ALMOST
2347 a 2347-a 176.39 182.98 <O,WA> HAVE WHAT I WOULD CALL A KILLER { E- / @ } KILLER BEE INSTINCT AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN CHARGE
2347 a 2347-a 183.11 299.63 <O,WA> AND AND I { TH- / @ } I THINK THEY LOSE A LOT BY WHAT I CALL NEUTERING THEIR HUSBANDS UHHUH OH SURE UHHUH HUH UHHUH
2347 b 2347-b 0.00 20.51 <O,WA> { UM / UH } ALL RIGHT UHHUH OH WELL I TEND I TEND TO AGREE { UM / UH } IN
2347 b 2347-b 20.51 25.06 <O,WA> SOME WAYS I THINK IT'S { UM / UH } I THINK IF ANYTHING A LOT OF { UM / UH } THE
2347 b 2347-b 25.07 31.12 <O,WA> CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED { UM / UH } IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE FOR THE BETTER BECAUSE I THINK WOMEN SHOULD
2347 b 2347-b 31.12 35.86 <O,NA> HAVE A CHOICE AND I DO BELIEVE IN THE BEING ABLE TO HAVE A CHOICE AS TO AS FAR AS WHAT
2347 b 2347-b 35.89 43.64 <O,WA> YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN AND I KNOW THIS FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I'VE WORKED AND I'VE NOT WORKED { UM / UH } { UM / UH }
2347 b 2347-b 43.64 54.81 <O,WA> THAT IT MAKES IT { UM / UH } SOMETIMES IT MAKES LIFE MORE DIFFICULT I THINK WHEN THE ROLES NOW ARE LESS DEFINED AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT { UM / UH } WOMEN SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE
2347 b 2347-b 54.82 66.66 <O,WA> DOING THAT IT IT { UM / UH } IT CAN MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT THERE ARE MORE THINGS TO WORK OUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS WITH WITH THE CHILD CARE AND
2347 b 2347-b 66.71 76.33 <O,WA> AND WITH { UM / UH } PLEASING YOU KNOW YOUR BOSS ON THE JOB SO YOU HAVE ADDED STRESSES FROM THERE AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT { UM / UH } THAT YOU NEED TO DO
2347 b 2347-b 76.33 85.71 <O,WA> AT HOME { A- / @ } AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOUR YOUR GOING OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR SO MANY HOURS A DAY DOESN'T { UM / UH } MAKE THOSE OTHER THINGS GO AWAY AND THE
2347 b 2347-b 85.76 98.9 <O,WA> OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES ARE STILL IMPORTANT { UM / UH } SO { UM / UH } HAVE YOU HAVE YOU WORKED OUTSIDE ALSO AND { UM / UH } FEEL THAT IT THAT WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL AS FAR AS { UM / UH } WHAT
2347 b 2347-b 98.91 192.7 <O,WA> WOULD BE A HAPPY MEDIUM OR OR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YES UHHUH UHHUH YES YES RIGHT BUT YEAH OH I { B- / @ } I THINK SO YES UHHUH UHHUH YEAH UHHUH WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK THOUGH { UM / UH } { UM / UH } I
2347 b 2347-b 192.70 208.68 <O,NA> DON'T KNOW I THE THE ONE PROBLEM I GUESS I HAVE AND MAYBE WHAT SO MANY WOMEN YOUNGER WOMEN NOW ARE CHOOSING TO GO OUTSIDE IS I FEEL THAT IN GENERAL IN THIS SOCIETY THAT BEING AT HOME IS NOT LOOKED
2347 b 2347-b 208.69 219.09 <O,WA> UPON AS { UM / UH } A JOB IN ITSELF WHEREAS YOU KNOW YOU HEAR A LOT OF WOMEN THAT ARE HOME SAYING THAT IT IS A JOB IN ITSELF BUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING AND I I
2347 b 2347-b 219.10 223.67 <O,WA> WAS { A- / @ } AN ENGINEER SO I I WAS ALWAYS WITH MEN { UM / UH } AND THEY
2347 b 2347-b 223.68 235.33 <O,NA> WERE SINGLE MANY OF THEM AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WELL MY DAY DOESN'T END WHEN I LEAVE AT I USED TO LEAVE AT THREE KEEP GOING TO ELEVEN AT NIGHT AND THEY HAD THEY USED TO LOOK DOWN
2347 b 2347-b 235.33 243.21 <O,NA> ON WOMEN THAT WERE HOME THEY'D SAY OH I BET YOU GO HOME AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST YOU GET OUT OF HERE AT THREE AND YOU CAN GO HOME AND PUT YOUR FEET UP AND WATCH SOAP OPERAS AND I
2347 b 2347-b 243.21 256.71 <O,WA> USED TO BE INFURIATED { BE- / @ } BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS INVOLVED ONCE I GOT HOME NOW TAKING CARE OF THEM RUNNING THEM EVERYWHERE HELPING WITH HOMEWORK THE BATH THE WHOLE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING { UM / UH } AND
2347 b 2347-b 256.80 271.58 <O,WA> I THINK THAT ONE REASON THAT SO MANY YOUNGER WOMEN FEEL { IM- / @ } COMPELLED TO GO INTO A PROFESSION IS THAT THEY FEEL THAT IF THEY STAY HOME THEY ARE NOT RESPECTED AND THAT BEING HOME IS NOT A
2347 b 2347-b 271.59 281.87 <O,WA> RESPECTABLE { UM / UH } POSITION IN SOCIETY AND THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH TO THAT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU WERE HOME AND WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK YOU GOT
2347 b 2347-b 281.91 299.79 <O,NA> BUT I CAN SEE WITH THE YOUNGER MEN THAT THEY DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING DOWN UPON WOMEN THAT ARE HOME AND YET BY THE SAME TOKEN I THINK SOME OF IT IS JEALOUSY YOU YOU ONCE IN A WHILE YOU HEAR THEM SAY THINGS LIKE I WISH I HAD THE CHOICE YOU
3129 a 3129-a 17.31 106.23 <O,WA> YEAH EXACTLY OH DID YOU DO THE DIAGNOSIS OR WAS IT JUST AN ASSUMPTION THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE PART THAT FAILED UHHUH UHHUH YEAH I KNOW { UM / UH } WHEN WORKING WITH THE { UM / UH } FLASHERS THERE IS
3129 a 3129-a 106.23 127.18 <O,WA> { UM / UH } USUALLY A A SPECIAL FUSE THAT OPERATES THE FLASHERS DO YOU HAVE A SEPARATE FUSE FOR YOUR HIGH BEAM AS OPPOSED TO YOUR LOW BEAM DIAGRAM YEAH I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MY CURRENT CARS HAVE
3129 a 3129-a 127.21 142.44 <O,NA> A SEPARATE FUSE I KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK THERE ARE THINGS RUNNING WHILE THEY'RE AT THE SAME UNIT LIKE THE THE HEADLAMP YOU TEND TO THINK WELL THERE'S ONE FUSE OPERATING THE WHOLE THING BUT SOMETIMES THE EXTRA AMPERAGE THAT
3129 a 3129-a 142.46 170.18 <O,NA> A HIGH BEAM DRIVES AS OPPOSED TO A LOW BEAM REQUIRES THE USE OF A OF A MAYBE A HIGHER FUSE SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY IS THIS A A MAIL ORDER PARTS HOUSE THAT SPECIALIZES IN IN PARTS FOR
3129 a 3129-a 170.19 272.8 <O,WA> { UM / UH } OLD IMPORTS WHO { UM / UH } SO IT'S NOT J C WHITNEY OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT YEAH HAVE YOU FOUND ANY { UM / UH } { UM / UH } RELIABLE IMPORT SERVICE PEOPLE IN THE METROPLEX OH YEAH UHHUH I'LL BE DARNED UHHUH

3129 b 3129-b 10.22 19.43 <O,WA> WORKING { UM / UH } THIS IS THE TYPE OF { UM / UH } SWITCH WHERE YOU FLIP THE THE LEVER THE TURN SIGNAL ON THE COLUMN AND WHEN I WOULD { UM / UH } PUT IT IN
3129 b 3129-b 19.45 31.62 <O,WA> THE BRIGHT LIGHT POSITION THE LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT COMPLETELY WHICH IS EVEN WORSE THAN THEM JUST NOT GETTING BRIGHT AND I HAD PRESUMED THAT IT WAS THE SWITCH AND { UM / UH } THIS IS { UM / UH } AN
3129 b 3129-b 31.74 40.49 <O,WA> OLDER CAR IT'S { A SEVENTY TWO / SEVENTY TWO } { M G / M_G } SO I HAD TO MAIL ORDER THE PART { UM / UH } WHICH I HAD DONE AND TONIGHT I WENT OUT AND { UM / UH } AT
3129 b 3129-b 40.50 52.28 <O,WA> LEAST HOOKED IN THE NEW PART ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THAT APPARENTLY IS NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S NOT IN THE SWITCH BECAUSE IT DOES THE SAME THING WITH THE NEW SWITCH SO I'LL BE FACED WITH HAVING TO RETURN THAT PRODUCT { UM / UH } AND
3129 b 3129-b 52.32 70.35 <O,WA> HOPING THAT { UM / UH } YOU KNOW THAT THEY WILL ACCEPT IT ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BOX IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT BEEN REALLY USED { UM / UH } I HAD DONE WHAT DIAGNOSIS I COULD PRIMARILY BY
3129 b 3129-b 70.35 84.03 <O,WA> LOOKING AT A WIRING DIAGRAM THAT I DID HAVE OF THE CAR AND { UM / UH } PRETTY MUCH DECIDED HAD TO BE THE PROBLEM I TALKED TO ONE MECHANIC ABOUT IT AND HE SUSPECTED THE SWITCH ALSO { UM / UH } BUT
3129 b 3129-b 84.04 96.88 <O,WA> I'VE NOT YEAH I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE IT IT THE OTHER SWITCH COULD BE THE MAIN SWITCH ITSELF { UM / UH } THAT TURNS THE LIGHTS ON OR OFF WHICH IS ON THE DASHBOARD { UM / UH } IT
3129 b 3129-b 96.88 123.58 <O,WA> MIGHT BE TIED INTO THE EQUATION SOMEHOW BUT I I DON'T KNOW I SHOULD LOOK AT THAT I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ONE IN THE { UM / UH } IN THE DIAGRAM BUT I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT
3129 b 3129-b 123.65 164.18 <O,WA> THAT UHHUH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WHAT I'VE TYPICALLY FOUND WHEN THAT { UM / UH } COMPANIES ARE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT ACCEPTING RETURNS ON PRODUCTS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEEDED AFTER ALL AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE
3129 b 3129-b 164.22 185.76 <O,WA> CASE THIS TIME RIGHT EXACTLY IT'S OUT OF { UM / UH } KANSAS SOMEWHERE NO IT'S NOT I ALSO GOT A PIECE OF CHROME FOR THE THE HOOD THAT THEY HAD INDICATED WAS THE RIGHT PART FOR THIS CAR BUT { UM / UH } IT
