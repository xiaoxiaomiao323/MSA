  [+] Added the capability to keep track of reference confidence scores
      when aligning ref ctm's against hyp ctm's.
  [*] Corrected the .pre dump of the alignment structure when the case
      sensitive flag is set.  The error was introduced by modifications.
  [*] Fixed a problem in TEXT_strcasecmp().  It failed to handle the
      case where str1 was shorter than srt2.
  [*] Fixed a problem in 'align.c/extract_speaker()' a NULL was not
      terminating each newly extracted speaker id.
  [/] Revised the reports lut, sum, snt, spkr,ovr to handle speakers W/o
      any reference tokens, In the sum report, the speakers W/o	
      reference tokens are ignored when computing the speaker
      mean, sd, and median.
  [*] fixed a  bug in tcslite.sh which output an error when test 5 was
      run and the use of gnudiff was not compiled in to sclite.
  [*] fixed a bug in config.in which was propagated to config.sh.  The 
      problem was a missing backquote on "uname -s".

      had been performed to make sure the ref and hyp files had the 
      same conversations and channels.
  [/] Fixed a problem in 'expand_words_to_chars()' it was not deleting
      hyphens from single character words do to an incorrect conditional.
  [+] Added a new way to score, 'Optionally Deletable'.  This required a
      major set of modifications and generalizations.
  [/] Modified the character scoring proceedure so that confidence scores
      are imputed to the sub-characters making up the word.

SCLITE Version 1.4a - Release May 29, 1997

      statistics in all output files.
  [+] Added algo2 for the inferred segmentation option '-S'

      transcript for an stm record.  See the stm file documentation for
      it's use.

SCLITE Version 1.3 - Release April 22, 1996
  [*] Corrected a minor makefile inconsistency. (One file was compiled 
      twice).
  [/] Changed Network_dp_align to optionally include NULLS in the output.
  [/] Changed the -m option to now reduce either the reference or 
      hypothesis file, or both before alignment takes place.

      in the 'dtl' and 'spk' reports.

      which caused a warning on some compilers.
  [+] Added a bug report proceedures.

SCLITE Version 1.2a - Release March 15, 1996

      had no reference words, but had errorneously hypothesized words.
  [+] Added the sent, spk, and ovrdtl reports to sclite.
  [+] Added the option to score CTM to CTM files.  This is essentially
      the same code used for the first SWB LVCSR evaluation, however, since
      the new network alignment routines were used unifying the alignment
  	   into a single step, alignments will differ slightly from those 
      generated with the old scoring package.
  [+] Added the "-T" option to do time-mediated alignments.
  [-] Removed the size limitations in the report generation software,
      'rpg.c'.  There is still are hard limit on the length of characters
      for each cell of 200.
  [/] Standardize program exit codes to be 0 for successfull execution
      and 1 for failed execution.
  [*] Correct the handling of NULL alternatives in the hypothesis file.
      Scoring reference to hypothesis yields the same error rates as
      scoring hypothesis to reference.  The only difference is insertions
      are swapped with deletions.
  [+] The installer now has the option to enable or disable alignments
      via GNU's diff.
  [+] Added informative error messages when label definitions, which are
      used by the 'lur' report, have been improperly specified.

SCLITE Version 1.1 - Release September 27, 1995
  [+] New/modified output options:
      * Added options to '-o':  'none' to not make any reports,
	     'sgml' to create an sgml file for alignments, 'lur' for the
	     labeled utterance report.
      * '-p'.  Pipes output of alignments to other sclite utilities.
       in the sgml format.
  [+] New Input options:
      * '-P' accepts piped sgml format input from other sclite utilities.
      * '-e' identifies the input character encoding.
  [+] New alignment options:
      * '-S' performs an inferred word segmentation algorithm rather
        than using the word segmentation of the reference and hyp files.
      * '-F' aligns fragments to words with matching substrings and scores
        them as correct.
      * Changed the -c option to include the optional flag "ASCIITOO"
        which also splits ascii words when doing a character alignment.
        Also added another flag, "DH", to delete hyphens from the ref and
        hyp transcripts before alingment.
  [*] Fixes and Changes:
      * Modified the '-n' option to handle multiple hyp files.
      * Fixed a bug in 'parse_stm_line' to handle empty texts.
      * Modified the read function for a CTM file so that any length
        file will be properly read in.
  [/] Compiled and tested using the HP-UX and DEC OSF1 native cc
      compilers.
